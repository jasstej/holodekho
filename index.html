            <h2 class="text-center">Introduction</h2>
            <p class="text-center">HOLODEKHO is a groundbreaking initiative dedicated to revolutionizing STEM education
                in India. By integrating advanced 3D holographic and immersive technologies, we aim to create engaging
                and interactive learning environments. Our mission is to simplify complex concepts, enhance
                comprehension, and foster curiosity among students.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="text-center">With features like collaborative spaces for student and hobbyist developers to
                contribute 3D/VR/AR models, HOLODEKHO is more than an educational platformâ€”it's a hub of innovation and
                creativity. Together, let's reshape the future of learning with tools that bridge the gap between
                imagination and understanding.</p>

    <!-- Problem Section -->
    <section id="problem" class="py-5 bg-light">
        <div class="container">
            <h2 class="text-center">The Problem</h2>
            <p class="text-center">Traditional STEM education methods often fail to engage students, leading to a lack
                of interest and understanding in critical subjects like science, technology, engineering, and
                mathematics. Complex concepts can be difficult to visualize, and the standard two-dimensional teaching
                tools are often inadequate for fully conveying these ideas.</p>

    </section>

    <!-- Solution Section -->
    <section id="solution" class="py-5">
        <div class="container">
            <h2 class="text-center">Our Solution</h2>
            <p class="text-center">HOLODEKHO addresses these challenges by leveraging 3D holographic images to create
                dynamic, interactive educational content. These holograms allow students to see and manipulate 3D models
                of molecules, mechanical systems, anatomical structures, and more, providing a hands-on learning
                experience that is both engaging and effective.</p>
